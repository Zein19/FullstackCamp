            <h2>Usopp</h2>
    
            <p>Pirating is in Usopp's blood as his father, Yasopp, is a crewmate of Red-Hair Shanks, one of the Four Emperors of the Sea. While he was too young to go to sea with his father, Ussop had always dreamed of meeting his father on the high seas as a pirate with a crew of his own. However, Usopp is an absolute coward and too afraid to sail out until Luffy invites him to join the Straw Hats, despite his cowardly nature and inclination to tell tall tales.</p>

            <p>Usopp's goal to become a brave warrior of the sea is a little vaguer than some of the other Straw Hats, but it's also one of the more relatable. Usopp's cowardice might seem weak in comparison to the other members of the crew, but it's, in some ways, one of the most human attitudes in the show. Few people can smirk in the face of a dangerous foe like Luffy and Zoro, and these reactions make Usopp the most relatable Straw Hat to many viewers.</p>
