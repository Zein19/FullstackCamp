            <p>There are few anime as expansive as One Piece, which recently aired its 1000th episode after airing for twenty years and counting. There's an entire generation that grew up on One Piece, watching from childhood well into adulthood. This great length is one of the first things people think of when it comes to One Piece and can feel like an insurmountable wall to picking up the show as it will take months to watch it in its entirety. The show's large cast is just one aspect of this daunting show, which will be explored here, with a guide to the Straw Hat Pirates. 
            <br> <br>
            One Piece is the story of Monkey D. Luffy, a young man with the ambitious goal of becoming the King of the Pirates and ruling the high seas. Alongside his trusted crew, Luffy sails the oceans, battling ferocious enemies and making lifelong friends as he hunts for the One Piece, the legendary treasure of the previous Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, which lies somewhere at the end of the world. Luffy's enemies might include the strongest pirates of his era and the officials of the World Government's strongest military force, the Navy, but nothing will stop him from achieving his goal.</p>
