            <h2>Nami</h2>
    
            <p>Also known as Cat Burglar Nami, the young navigator became known for stealing huge sums of cash from pirates. Initially, she only joined Luffy's crew to scam him to earn money to buy her hometown from the pirate, Arlong, but joins Luffy's crew for real after Luffy defeats the fishman. Always looking for a way to make a quick buck, Nami's innate skill at reading the weather and ocean has made her an indispensable part of the crew as their navigator.</p>

            <p>Nami's ultimate goal is to draw a complete world atlas, which would require her to sail to parts of the world nobody's ever seen. This makes her a perfect companion to Luffy, who wants to sail everywhere. Nami also provides a voice of reason for the crew, reigning in some of the wilder personalities to help keep them focused as much as she can alongside the wild pirates.</p>
