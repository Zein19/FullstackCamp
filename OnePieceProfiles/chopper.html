            <p>Another inhuman member of the crew, Chopper is a reindeer who ate the Human-Human Fruit, a Devil Fruit that gave him the ability to become a human. The people on his home island shunned Chopper as a monster, and he was taken in by a mad doctor named Hiriluk, who taught Chopper about medicine. Chopper carries the late Hiriluk's will, aspiring to become the world's best doctor who can cure any disease.
                <br><br>
            Chopper is the resident cute member of the Straw Hat Pirates and more of a non-combatant, though he never seems to fully escape a fight. He's capable of fighting thanks to his Devil Fruit powers but prefers to leave the fighting to the Monster Trio while he hides and heals. His cheerfulness and naivety make him an incredibly endearing character, and he has the lowest bounty of the crew at a measly 100 Berries compared to Luffy's 1.5 billion Berry bounty.
