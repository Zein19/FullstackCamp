            <h2>Monkey D Luffy</h2>
    
            <p>Luffy is the main character, and he carries much of the show on his shoulders. Eternally optimistic and rather foolish, Luffy is a simple man with simple dreams, even though those simple dreams would reshape the world around him. Anybody who meets Luffy would find it hard to consider him a criminal, however. Luffy is always cheerful and trying to help out anybody he considers a friend - which is pretty much anybody who doesn't try to attack him.</p>

            <p>Friendship is at Luffy's core as he'll do anything to protect his friends and family, including breaking into the world's most secure prison and declaring war on the World Government. His sheer passion for life is infectious in the best way, inspiring other characters to fight for whatever it is they want to achieve, no matter how ludicrous the goal might seem or how much others laugh at them for it.</p>
