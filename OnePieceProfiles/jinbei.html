            <p>Finally, we have Jinbe, the most recent character to join the Straw Hat Crew. Jinbe is one of the most significant members of the Straw Hats. Before joining, he was once a member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, one of the three great powers on the ocean, and he served Emperor Big Mom as one of her most trusted subordinates. Also known as the First Son of the Sea, Jinbe's a fearsome fishman and master of Fishman Karate.
            <br><br>
            Unlike other members of the crew who joined to fulfill specific desires, Jinbe was drawn to the Straw Hats by Luffy's character. Jinbe initially agreed to project Luffy as a favor to Luffy's brother, Ace, but quickly grew to respect the young pirate and realized that if anybody could change the world, it would be Luffy as he became the King of the Pirates. A character defined by his honor, Jinbe joined Luffy to help support the future King of the Pirates and start a new age on the high seas.</p>
