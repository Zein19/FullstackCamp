            <h2>Brook</h2>
    
            <p>Brook is the oldest member of the crew and happens to be a living skeleton. He died at sea and his Devil Fruit, the Revive-Revive Fruit, resurrecting him, though only after his body had already decomposed. Luffy and the Straw Hats found Brook drifting at sea in a broken ship before he joined their crew as a musician so he could sail around the world and meet with the whale Laboo, the only living member of his crew.</p>

            <p>Brook is a skilled swordsman, though he lacks Zoro's raw power in favor of speed and finesse with his trademark move cutting people and walking away before they realize it, similar to old-fashioned samurai movies. Brook's age makes him one of the wisest Straw Hats, and he has a very different view of the seas than his crewmates as Brook was an experienced pirate while many of the biggest names on the sea like Gol D. Roger were mere rookies getting their feet wet.</p>
