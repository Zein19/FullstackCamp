            <h2>Vinsmoke Sanji</h2>
    
            <p>Sanji fulfills one of the most important roles on the ship: The cook capable of whipping up the vast quantities of food that Luffy consumes. The wayward prince of the nation of Germa, Sanji met Luffy while serving as a chef at the floating sea restaurant Baratie. He joined up with Luffy to achieve his dream of finding the All Blue, a legendary ocean where fish from all the world's oceans live together, allowing a cook to make any dish he could dream of.</p>

            <p>Sanji stands out as having a unique fighting style focused primarily on kicking, refusing to risk damaging his hands, or using his knife skills on anything but food as a matter of principle. Sanji also loves any woman he sets his eyes on, going insane and bending over backward for them. Sanji is one of the strongest members of the crew, with many fans dubbing the trifecta of Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji the “Monster Trio.”</p>
