            <h2>Roronoa Zoro</h2>
    
            <p>The first member to join Luffy's crew, Zoro is a skilled swordsman who wants to push himself to the high peaks of his profession and become the world's greatest swordsman. Before joining Luffy, Zoro made a living as a bounty hunter tracking down pirates and handing them over to the Navy to collect a profit. But after joining Luffy, Zoro became a member of the Worst Generation, considered to be the strongest rookie pirates on the sea.</p>

            <p>Zoro is one of Luffy's most loyal crewmates and a living embodiment of badassery. His innate serious nature lets him play off other, more comedic members of the crew while his mastery of Three-Sword Style sword fighting lets him battle alongside Luffy against even his strongest foes. The only place Zoro isn't skilled in is his sense of direction, with him being the only member of the Straw Hats to get lost on a straight road in the history of the show.</p>
