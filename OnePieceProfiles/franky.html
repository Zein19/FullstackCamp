            <h2>Franky</h2>
    
            <p>Franky is a cyborg who increasingly replaces his human body parts with robotic ones and is one of the greatest shipwrights in the world of One Piece. Franky built The Thousand Sunny, the high-tech ship that the Straw Hat Pirates currently sail on. Franky wants to follow in the footsteps of his mentor, Tom, and build a ship that could sail around the world's most perilous seas. He joined Luffy and his crew to make sure that the Sunny could make the trip while also adding a bit of muscle.</p>

            <p>Franky is easily the most flamboyant member of the crew and puts everything he has into everything he does. He's quick to sympathize with the underdog and shed a flood of tears while fighting for them. Franky is passionate and brilliant about his robotics and, in some ways, acts as an older brother to the crew, entertaining them while keeping them safe and afloat.</p>
