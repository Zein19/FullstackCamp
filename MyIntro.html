        <h2> About me</h2>
        <h3> Brief background </h3>

        <p> My name is Zein. I recently graduated from uni in engineering but I decided I'd rather get into tech and came across this bootcamp which I saw as a good opportunity while I am job searching. </p>

        <h3> Interests </h3>

        <p> I like football and basketball, and my favourite teams are Chelsea and the Boston Celtics. I'm also a big One Piece fan and into manga and anime, and also gaming.</p>
